Zoe Depth Estimation API

Overview

The Zoe Depth Estimation API is a deep-learning model designed to estimate depth from images using PyTorch. This API leverages FastAPI to provide an efficient and scalable endpoint for real-time depth estimation.

Features
- Fast and accurate depth estimation
- API-based integration with FastAPI
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Requires an API key from imgbb for image handling
- Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- FastAPI (for running app.py)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
